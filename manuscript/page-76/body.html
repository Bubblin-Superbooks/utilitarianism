<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">Intention. There is no point which utilitarian thinkers (and Bentham pre-eminently) have taken more pains to illustrate than this. The morality of the action depends entirely upon the intention—that is, upon what the agent <em>wills to do</em>. But the motive, that is, the feeling which makes him will so to do, when it makes no difference in the act, makes none in the morality: though it makes a great difference in our moral estimation of the agent, especially if it indicates a good or a bad habitual _disposition_—a bent of character from which useful, or from which hurtful actions are likely to arise.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
